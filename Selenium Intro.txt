Functional Testing ---> A behaviour of application whether it is behaving according to customer needs or not
like Buttons, links these comes under functional testing

Re-Testing Testing ---> We need to execute the same test case again and again with multiple sets of data
Re-Regression Testing --->  For every version of the build we will test the defects that reported earlier so that it should not imapct other functionality.

Therefore, Automation solves the re-testing and regression testin gprobelm\

---------------------------
Automation Tools:- a. Functional Testing Tools ---> QTP/UFT, Selenium 
                   b. Performace Testing Tools ---> JMeter, LoadRunner
				   c. Test Management Tools ---->  Used to maintain test cases and defect reporting , execution status and report generation 
													eg. Quality Center, MS VSTP
				   d. Defect Reporting Tools ---> BugZilla, Remedy, Devrack
				   
				   JIRA---> used for Test management, defect management, Dashboards(Overall test cases oerview)
				   

-----------------------------				  
Advantages of Selenium :- a. Open Source Tool
						  b. It supports multiple languages ( Java, python, C#, Ruby)
						  c. Multiple Operating System
						  d. It supports Multiple Browsers(Cross- Browser Testing)
						  e. It supports Parallel Testing
						  f. It can integrate third party tools eg- TestNG, Cucumber, Maven, Jenkins. Git & Git Hub
-----------------------------	
What is Parallel Testing ?

The process of testing multiple applications or components of the application concurrently, to reduce the test time						  

-------------------------------
Disadvantages oif Selenium :- a. Selnium is used only for Web based application testing, it dosen't support desktop application i.e window based apps like MS-Office, notepad, calculator.---> we can use AutoIT, Sikuli for desktop based apps testing 
							  b. Selenium does not have any dedicated support or team issues realting to selenium software.---> Forums available online
							  c. No reporting facility(i.e- deatiled testing report like no of test case passed, failed etc)----> TestNG, Extents used 
							  d. It does not support images/graphs testingm. ---> Only a certain level of images can be verified.
All these limitations can be overcome using third party applications.

------------------------------------

Selenium ----> Selenium is a set of components/tools 
In other words Selenium is a suite which contains multiple components/tools

Selenium Suite components
-------------------------------
1) Selenium IDE
2) Selenium RC
3) Selenium webdriver
4) Selenium Grid

Selenium 1 ---> IDE, RC, Grid
Selenium 2----> IDE, WebDriver, Grid
Selenium 3-----> WebDriver, Grid


IDE ----->Plugin for firefox browser, record and play back tool 
RC --->RC server will interact with the browser and execute Automating Test Cases-- Automating test cases (As it was indirect process and if more test cases are there the process is slow)
WebDriver ---> WebDriver is an API which will automate your test cases
Grid ---> You can execute test cases remotly.
